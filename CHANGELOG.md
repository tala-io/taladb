# Changelog

## 0.11.6 — 2026-09-14

- Fixed `libtaladb_jsi.so` being linked with 4 KB page alignment, which made any app bundling the React Native binding fail Google Play's 16 KB page size requirement for Android 15 and later, and prevented it loading at all on a 16 KB device. The C++ glue now links with `-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384` explicitly; the prebuilt Rust libraries were already aligned.
- Stopped the Android binding pinning `ndkVersion` to r27 unconditionally. It now honours `ext.ndkVersion` from the consuming app's root `build.gradle` — which the React Native template sets — and falls back to r27.1 only when the app declares none. Pinning it forced every consumer onto an NDK whose default page alignment is 4 KB, regardless of what the rest of their application was built with.

No API, storage-format or behaviour change: this is a link-time fix. Android consumers should rebuild to pick it up; a clean build of the `:taladb_react-native` module is needed because the object is cached per CMake configuration.

## 0.11.5 — 2026-09-13

- Raised HNSW recall by building layer 0 with `M_max0 = 2M` links, matching the algorithm and the pruning limit the same function already applied; recall@10 rose from 91.5% to 97.5% at efSearch 100 over 2,000 vectors, and from 93.5% to 99.5% at efSearch 400 over 10,000.
- Cut HNSW graph construction time by roughly 12%: 12.0s to 10.8s at 2,000 vectors and 155s to 136s at 10,000, both at 384 dimensions.
- Removed a heap clone of the stored vector on every distance computation by borrowing from the graph's decoder instead of returning an owned copy.
- Cached each node's squared norm so cosine scoring no longer recomputes it per comparison, and replaced SipHash with a multiplicative hash for internal graph node ids.
- Shared one node cache across an insert's two readers, across its back-linking pass, and across ANN retry attempts, removing repeated storage reads and decodes of nodes already in memory.
- Carried the full candidate set between layers during insertion instead of only the nearest, per Malkov/Yashunin algorithm 1.
- Added `cargo run -p taladb-core --example hnsw_profile` for measuring build time, query latency and recall against exact ground truth, with a cluster-spread argument for separating index quality from data difficulty.
- Documented the remaining graph-traversal cost and recall-at-scale gaps in the roadmap, and corrected a stale entry that described HNSW as available only in the Node binding.

No storage-format change: existing graphs open and search without a rebuild. Rebuilding an index built by an earlier version picks up the layer-0 improvement.

## 0.11.4 - 2026-09-12

- Added full-text, vector, hybrid, and aggregation queries to the React Native TypeScript surface.
- Replaced the memory-only `instant-distance` layer with portable, transactional HNSW graphs that persist and update on browser, Node.js, and React Native.
- Added configurable graph construction and query-time `efSearch`, exact rescoring, scalar/binary quantization, explicit exact/ANN modes, score thresholds, pagination, and grouping.
- Added persistent index status plus resumable, cancellable batch rebuilds with progress reporting; `db.rebuildVectorIndexes()` remains available for maintenance and legacy migration.
- Added filtered ANN as an explicit opt-in while keeping filtered queries exact by default, plus recall measurement against exact ground truth.
- Fixed the `build:cbindgen` script and config, which regenerated an unusable FFI header.
- Documented persistent HNSW lifecycle, mobile-safe rebuild scheduling, hybrid search, and package choice in the React Native guide.
- Added a CI job that compiles the React Native C++ glue and checks the generated FFI header.
