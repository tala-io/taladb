# Roadmap

What's planned for TalaDB, roughly in order of impact. Shipped work is recorded
in the [changelog](https://github.com/tala-sh/taladb/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md);
this page tracks only what's still open.

Have an idea, or want to help prioritise? Open a
[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/tala-sh/taladb/discussions) or a feature
request issue.

## Developer experience

- **Change webhook delivery guarantees** — coalescing so a bulk import sends one
  request instead of hundreds, an opt-in durable outbox for at-least-once
  delivery, and acknowledged multi-tab write forwarding. See the
  [webhook API](/api/webhook).
- **Schema migrations on React Native** — the version accessors are wired
  through the native stack and await on-device verification. Read-time
  migrations already ship on browser and Node — see
  [Schema Validation](/api/schema).
- **Compound index coverage** — use an index when only the leading fields are
  constrained or the last is a range, per-field descending order, and an array
  shorthand for `createIndex`.
- **`taladb generate`** — emit TypeScript interfaces for each collection,
  inferred from the documents already stored.
- **Svelte and Vue adapters** — `@taladb/svelte` stores and `@taladb/vue`
  composables, over the same event model as the [React hooks](/guide/react).
- **VS Code extension** — filter-expression highlighting, inline document
  previews, and a collection browser.

## Performance & vector search

The goal is to keep TalaDB among the fastest embedded databases on every
JavaScript runtime.

- **Faster vector index builds** — graph construction is the current limit on
  large indexes, and the main thing standing between approximate search and
  mobile devices.
- **Better approximate-search recall at scale** — recall falls off faster as a
  collection grows than it should.
- **Lower graph traversal cost** — smarter cache eviction and leaner cached
  nodes, so larger graphs stay resident in memory.
- **Wider native SIMD** — a runtime-detected AVX2/NEON kernel on top of the
  portable vectorisation already in place.
- **Faster filtered vector search** — stop materialising whole documents just to
  collect the ids a filter matched.
- **Index tuning guidance by device class** — recommended parameters from
  low-memory phones through desktops.
- **Adaptive cache sizing** — size the decoded-vector cache from the device's
  memory budget instead of one fixed default.
- **Continuous benchmarks** — run the suites in CI each release and publish the
  trend, so regressions are caught before they ship.

## Storage

- **Pluggable serialisation** — swap the internal encoding for MessagePack or
  CBOR, to interoperate with formats you already use.
- **Document TTL** — set an expiry when you write a document and have it swept
  automatically.

---

## Platform

- **Swift and Kotlin packages** — first-party wrappers over the C FFI for native
  iOS and Android apps, without React Native.
- **WASI target** — run the same engine inside Wasmtime, WasmEdge and Fastly
  Compute.
