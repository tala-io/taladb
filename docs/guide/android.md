# Android (Kotlin)

Use TalaDB from a native Android app written in Kotlin, without React Native.
It is the same Rust engine as every other runtime: documents, filters,
indexes, [vector search](/api/vector-search),
[full-text and hybrid search](/api/search), live queries and encryption at
rest, all on the device.

::: warning Early release
The Kotlin package is new. Its API may still change before it is published,
and it is **not on Maven Central yet**. To try it now, build it from source
(see [below](#build-from-source)). Feedback and issues are welcome on
[tala-io/taladb-kotlin](https://github.com/tala-io/taladb-kotlin).
:::

## Requirements

- `minSdk` 24 or higher
- Kotlin 2.2+, with the kotlinx.serialization plugin for typed collections
- ABIs: `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`, all 16 KB page aligned as Google
  Play requires for apps targeting Android 15+

## Installation

Once published, add the dependency and the serialization plugin:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.serialization") version "<your Kotlin version>"
}

dependencies {
    implementation("dev.taladb:taladb-android:<version>")
}
```

### Build from source

Until then, build the AAR from the repository. You need JDK 17, the Android
SDK with an NDK, Rust with `cargo-ndk`, and a checkout of this engine next to
it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tala-io/taladb
git clone https://github.com/tala-io/taladb-kotlin
cd taladb-kotlin
scripts/build-engine.sh ../taladb                       # builds the engine for every ABI
./gradlew :taladb:publishToMavenLocal                    # dev.taladb:taladb-android:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Then add `mavenLocal()` to your app's repositories and depend on
`dev.taladb:taladb-android:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

## Quick start

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class Note(
    @SerialName("_id") val id: String? = null,
    val title: String,
    val tags: List<String> = emptyList(),
)

val db = TalaDB.open(context.filesDir.resolve("app.db"))   // keep one per process
val notes = db.collection<Note>("notes")

val id = notes.insert(Note(title = "Groceries", tags = listOf("home")))
val home = notes.find(buildJsonObject { put("tags", "home") })

notes.updateOne(
    buildJsonObject { put("_id", id) },
    buildJsonObject { putJsonObject("\$set") { put("title", "Weekly groceries") } },
)
```

Every operation is a `suspend` function that runs on `Dispatchers.IO` (or a
dispatcher you pass to `open`), so it is safe to call from the main thread.
One `TalaDB` can be shared across threads and coroutines.

- **Filters, updates and pipelines** use the same operators as every other
  runtime — see [Filters](/api/filters), [Updates](/api/updates) and
  [Aggregation](/api/aggregation) — built with `buildJsonObject`.
- **`_id`**: leave it `null` on insert and the engine assigns a ULID.
- **Untyped access**: `db.collection("name")` works with raw `JsonObject`s.
- **Errors**: engine errors throw `TalaDBException`; calls after `close()`
  throw `IllegalStateException`.

## Live queries

`watch` returns a `Flow`. It emits the current result, then a fresh one after
every write that changes it. Rapid writes coalesce into one emission, and
nothing is missed:

```kotlin
notes.watch(buildJsonObject { put("done", false) })
    .collect { open -> render(open) }
```

See [Live Queries](/api/live-queries).

## Vector and hybrid search

```kotlin
notes.createVectorIndex("embedding", dimensions = 384)
val similar = notes.findNearest("embedding", queryVector, topK = 5)

notes.createFtsIndex("title")
val hits = notes.hybridSearch("title", "groceries", "embedding", queryVector, topK = 5)
```

`searchVectors` adds exact or approximate mode, `efSearch`, thresholds,
pagination and grouping. `rebuildVectorIndex` builds an HNSW graph in
cancellable batches with progress reporting.

## Migrations

```kotlin
val db = TalaDB.open(file, migrations = listOf(
    Migration(1, "Index users by email") { db -> db.collection("users").createIndex("email") },
))
```

Pending migrations run in version order at open, with the same
checkpoint-per-version semantics as [Migrations](/api/migrations).

## Encryption

```kotlin
val db = TalaDB.open(file, TalaDBConfig(passphrase = key))
```

See [Encryption](/api/encryption).

## How it works

The package calls the engine's C FFI through a small JNI layer, and ships the
engine's prebuilt Android libraries in the AAR. At open it checks that the
library's C ABI version matches the one it was built for, so a mismatched
engine fails with a clear error. Full API reference:
[tala-io/taladb-kotlin](https://github.com/tala-io/taladb-kotlin).
