# CLI Dev Tools

The `taladb` CLI lets you inspect, export, and manage TalaDB database files from the terminal — useful for debugging, data migration, and CI pipelines.

## Installation

One line, no version to look up:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/taladb/taladb/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

It detects your platform, downloads the matching binary from the newest release,
and installs to `/usr/local/bin` — asking for `sudo` only if that directory is
not writable.

Two knobs:

```sh
# pin a release
VERSION=v0.11.0 curl -fsSL https://github.com/taladb/taladb/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# install somewhere else (created if missing, no sudo)
INSTALL_DIR=~/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://github.com/taladb/taladb/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

::: tip Prefer to read it first?
It is a plain shell script, and piping a URL into `bash` is worth being fussy
about:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/taladb/taladb/releases/latest/download/install.sh -o install.sh
less install.sh && bash install.sh
```
:::

### Other ways

::: code-group

```sh [From source]
# any platform with a Rust toolchain — also the path for Linux arm64,
# which has no prebuilt binary yet
cargo install --git https://github.com/taladb/taladb taladb-cli
taladb --version
```

```powershell [Windows]
# Download taladb-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip from the releases page,
# extract it, and add the folder to your PATH.
taladb --version
```

```sh [Manual download]
# Every asset is version-free, so `latest` always resolves:
#   taladb-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
#   taladb-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
#   taladb-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
#   taladb-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
curl -fsSL https://github.com/taladb/taladb/releases/latest/download/taladb-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz | tar -xz
sudo mv taladb /usr/local/bin/
taladb --version
```

:::

Prebuilt binaries cover macOS (Apple silicon and Intel), Linux x86_64, and
Windows x86_64.

## Commands

### `studio` — local web UI

Start a local browser-based UI for exploring and editing a TalaDB database. The server runs until you press Ctrl+C.

```sh
taladb studio ./myapp.db
```

A browser window opens automatically at `http://localhost:4321`. The UI shows all collections in the sidebar, displays documents in a paginated table, lets you filter with the search bar, inspect the full JSON of any document, and delete individual documents.

```sh
# Use a different port
taladb studio ./myapp.db --port 8080

# Print the URL but do not open a browser
taladb studio ./myapp.db --no-open
```

**Flags**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--port` | `4321` | Port to listen on |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Address to bind |
| `--no-open` | `false` | Skip opening a browser window |

The database file is opened read-write. Deletions made through the UI are permanent and cannot be undone.

::: danger `--host` has no authentication behind it
The studio binds to loopback by default for a reason: there is no login, no
token, and no read-only mode. Binding `0.0.0.0` gives everyone who can reach
that address the ability to read and delete your data. The CLI prints a warning
when you do it; that warning is the only thing standing between the flag and an
open database.
:::

::: tip One process at a time
The database takes an exclusive lock, so `taladb studio` will not open a file
your application already has open — it exits with *"Database already open.
Cannot acquire lock."* Stop the app first, or point the studio at a copy.
:::

**Platform compatibility**

`taladb studio` opens any `.db` file on disk using the Rust core directly — it is not specific to any one SDK.

| Platform | Works? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** (`@taladb/node`) | ✅ Yes | Primary use case — point at the same `.db` file your app uses |
| **React Native** | ✅ Yes | Copy the `.db` off the device first (see below) |
| **Browser / OPFS** | ✗ No | OPFS files live inside the browser's sandboxed filesystem, unreachable from the CLI |

For **React Native**, pull the file with `adb` (Android) or Xcode's device file browser (iOS), then open it:

```sh
adb pull /data/data/com.myapp/files/myapp.db ./myapp.db
taladb studio ./myapp.db
```

For **browser / OPFS**, export a snapshot from within your app and download it, then open the downloaded file:

```ts
// In your app — export to a downloadable file. `exportSnapshot` is on the raw
// @taladb/web handle, not on the object openDB() returns.
import init, { TalaDbWeb } from '@taladb/web'

await init()
const bytes = TalaDbWeb.open('myapp.db').exportSnapshot()
const a = Object.assign(document.createElement('a'), {
  href: URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([bytes])),
  download: 'myapp.db',
})
a.click()
```

```sh
taladb studio ~/Downloads/myapp.db
```

---

### `inspect` — database overview

Print all collections, their document counts, and any vector indexes defined on them.

```sh
taladb inspect ./myapp.db
```

```
TalaDB Inspector
────────────────
File: myapp.db

Collections (3):
  articles  (1247 documents)
    Indexes:         category, locale, publishedAt
    Text indexes:    body
    Vector indexes:  embedding
  sessions  (8 documents)
  users  (56 documents)
    Indexes:         email, age
```

Indexes are listed under the collection they belong to. A line is omitted when
a collection has none of that kind, so a collection with no indexes at all
shows just its name and count.

---

### `collections` — list collection names

Print one collection name per line (useful for scripting).

```sh
taladb collections ./myapp.db
```

---

### `count` — count documents

```sh
taladb count ./myapp.db users
# 56
```

---

### `export` — dump a collection

Export all documents in a collection to JSON, NDJSON, or CSV.

```sh
# Pretty-printed JSON array (default) — prints to stdout
taladb export ./myapp.db users

# Write to a file
taladb export ./myapp.db users --out users.json

# Newline-delimited JSON (one document per line)
taladb export ./myapp.db users --fmt ndjson --out users.ndjson

# CSV (flat fields only)
taladb export ./myapp.db users --fmt csv --out users.csv
```

**Flags**

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--fmt` | `-f` | `json` | Output format: `json`, `ndjson`, `csv` |
| `--out` | `-o` | stdout | Output file path |

**Embedding fields** are exported as regular JSON arrays of numbers — no special handling needed. A document with an `embedding` field exports exactly as stored:

```json
{
  "_id": "01HWZZQ0000000000000000000",
  "title": "How to reset your password",
  "embedding": [0.023, -0.141, 0.887, "...383 more values..."]
}
```

This means export + import round-trips preserve embedding data faithfully. The **vector index itself is not exported** — only the raw field values are. After importing into a new database, call `createVectorIndex` in your application startup to rebuild the index from the stored embedding fields.

---

### `import` — bulk insert from JSON / NDJSON

Import documents from a JSON array file or NDJSON file. New ULIDs are assigned — any `_id` fields in the source are ignored.

```sh
# From a JSON array
taladb import ./myapp.db users users.json

# From NDJSON
taladb import ./myapp.db users users.ndjson
```

The database file is created if it does not exist.

**Importing documents with embeddings:** If your exported documents contain numeric array fields (e.g. `embedding`), those values are inserted as-is. The vector index is **not** automatically created — call `createVectorIndex` in your application after import to make the field searchable:

```ts
// After taladb import ./dev.db articles articles.ndjson
const db = await openDB('./dev.db')
await db.collection('articles').createVectorIndex('embedding', { dimensions: 384 })
// Backfill runs automatically — all imported docs with a valid 'embedding' field are indexed
```

---

### `drop` — clear a collection

Delete all documents in a collection. Indexes defined on the collection are preserved.

```sh
taladb drop ./myapp.db sessions
# Deleted 8 documents from 'sessions'
```

---

### `upgrade-vector-index` — rebuild HNSW graph

Promote a flat or legacy vector index, or compact an existing persistent HNSW graph from the current flat vector table. Normal document writes update the graph transactionally, so routine writes do not require a rebuild.

```sh
taladb upgrade-vector-index ./myapp.db articles embedding
# HNSW graph for 'articles::embedding' rebuilt successfully.
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `<file>` | Path to the TalaDB database file |
| `<collection>` | Collection name |
| `<field>` | Vector field name |

This command is a no-op when:
- The index was created as flat-only (no HNSW options were stored)
- The binary was compiled without the `vector-hnsw` feature

You can also trigger this programmatically: see [`upgradeVectorIndex`](/api/collection#upgradevectorindexfield) in the Collection API docs.

---

## Common workflows

**Back up a collection before a migration:**

```sh
taladb export ./prod.db users --out users-backup.json
```

**Seed a local dev database from production export:**

```sh
taladb import ./dev.db users users-backup.json
```

**Check document counts in CI:**

```sh
COUNT=$(taladb count ./test.db results)
if [ "$COUNT" -lt 1 ]; then
  echo "No results written — test failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Seed a vector collection from an exported dataset:**

Export from one database, import into another, then rebuild the vector index at app startup:

```sh
# 1. Export from production (embeddings included as plain JSON arrays)
taladb export ./prod.db articles --fmt ndjson --out articles.ndjson

# 2. Import into local dev database
taladb import ./dev.db articles articles.ndjson

# 3. In your app startup — createVectorIndex backfills all imported docs automatically
```

```ts
const db = await openDB('./dev.db')
const articles = db.collection('articles')
await articles.createVectorIndex('embedding', { dimensions: 384 })
```

**Verify vector data is present after import:**

```sh
# Count should match what was exported
taladb count ./dev.db articles

# Inspect to confirm the vector index was created by the app
taladb inspect ./dev.db
# articles  (1247 documents)
#   Vector indexes:  embedding
```

## Planned commands

The following commands are planned for a future release:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `taladb vector-indexes ./myapp.db` | List all vector indexes across all collections |
| `taladb find-nearest ./myapp.db <collection> <field> <vector-json> --top 5` | Run a similarity query from the terminal |
| `taladb drop-vector-index ./myapp.db <collection> <field>` | Remove a vector index |
