# Privacy Policy for Kepta

**Last updated: 20 September 2026**

Kepta is a personal memory app for Android, published by ThinkGrid Labs. It is
built on [TalaDB](/introduction), an embedded database that runs entirely on the
device — this page is hosted alongside TalaDB's documentation because both are
published by the same developer.

## The short version

**Kepta collects nothing.** There is no account, no server, no analytics, no
advertising, and no crash reporting. Everything you write stays on your phone.

This is not a promise about how we choose to behave. The released app is built
**without Android's internet permission**, so the operating system will not let
it open a network connection at all. You can verify this yourself: turn on
airplane mode and keep using the app — nothing changes, because nothing in it
ever needed a connection.

## What Kepta stores, and where

Everything you enter — the things you record, the memories you write, any photos
you attach — is stored in Kepta's private storage on your device:

- Your records are kept in an encrypted database.
- Photos and other attachments are encrypted before they are written to storage,
  and decrypted only while you are viewing them.
- The encryption key is protected by the PIN you choose when you first open the
  app. Your PIN itself is never stored anywhere.

None of it is transmitted to us or to anyone else, because there is nothing in
the app capable of transmitting it.

## What we receive

Nothing. We have no servers that Kepta communicates with, so we do not receive,
store, process, or have any means of accessing your information. We cannot read
your records, and we cannot recover them for you if you lose access to them.

## Permissions the app requests

| Permission | Why | What leaves your device |
|---|---|---|
| **Camera** | To photograph a receipt, a serial number or an item, and attach it to a memory. Only used when you choose to take a photo. | Nothing. The photo is encrypted and saved locally. |
| **Notifications** | To show reminders you have asked for — for example, a warranty running out. | Nothing. Reminders are scheduled by your phone; there is no push service. |
| **Run at startup** | So reminders you have already scheduled survive a restart. | Nothing. |
| **Biometrics / fingerprint** | Optional, as a faster way to unlock instead of typing your PIN. | Nothing. Biometric data never leaves the device's secure hardware and is never seen by the app. |

Kepta requests **no internet permission**, no location, no contacts, and no
access to your general files or photo library. Choosing an existing photo uses
Android's own picker, which hands Kepta a single image you selected without
giving it access to anything else.

## Sharing and disclosure

We do not share your information, because we do not have it. We cannot sell it,
disclose it to third parties, or hand it over in response to a legal request —
there is nothing on our side to hand over.

If you choose to export your records, Kepta creates a plain file and passes it to
whatever app you select — email, a cloud drive, a messaging app. From that point
the file is handled by that app and by whoever you send it to, under their terms
rather than ours.

## Deleting your data

Uninstalling Kepta removes everything it stored. You can also clear it at any
time from Android's app settings ("Clear storage"). Because nothing is backed up
to us or to any cloud service, deletion is immediate and complete, and there is
no copy anywhere for us to delete on your behalf.

## Children

Kepta is a general-audience app and is not directed at children. It collects no
personal information from anyone, including children.

## Changes to this policy

If a future version of Kepta ever adds a feature that transmits data — for
example an optional, encrypted backup across your own devices — this policy will
be updated before that version is released, and the app itself will say clearly
what has changed. Any such feature would require the app to request internet
permission, which is publicly visible on its Play Store listing.
