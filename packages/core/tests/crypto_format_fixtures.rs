//! Frozen cryptographic fixtures — the on-disk contract for encrypted databases.
//!
//! Requires `--features encryption`.
//!
//! These vectors were produced by `aes-gcm 0.10` / `pbkdf2 0.12` and must keep
//! decoding byte-for-byte across every future dependency bump. An encrypted
//! TalaDB file in the field is only readable if `derive_key` maps the same
//! passphrase and salt to the same key, and `decrypt` accepts a ciphertext this
//! codebase wrote at an earlier version.
//!
//! If a RustCrypto upgrade breaks one of these, the upgrade is not a dependency
//! bump — it is a storage format migration, and it needs a version bump in
//! `CRYPTO_FORMAT_V1` plus a re-encryption path like
//! `migrate_encrypted_v0_to_v1`. Do not "fix" these numbers to match new output.
