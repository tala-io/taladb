//! The crate-wide error type.
//!
//! # Why storage failures are split by kind
//!
//! TalaDB runs on-device, where the application — not an operator — has to
//! decide what to do when a write fails. "Retry in a moment" is right for a
//! contended transaction and badly wrong for a corrupt page or a full disk.
//! Every storage failure used to be flattened into `Storage(String)` with the
//! underlying error stringified, which erased both the distinction and the
//! [`std::error::Error::source`] chain needed to recover it.
//!
//! Each storage failure now carries its originating [`redb`] error as a real
//! source, so callers can walk the chain (or downcast) to make that decision:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use taladb::TalaDbError;
//! # fn handle(err: TalaDbError) {
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! if let Some(source) = err.source() {
//!     if let Some(io_err) = source.downcast_ref::<redb::StorageError>() {
//!         // Disk-level failure — distinguishable from a table or commit error.
//!         eprintln!("storage layer: {io_err}");
//!     }
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! [`Display`](std::fmt::Display) output is unchanged: each variant still
//! renders the same `storage error: …` / `serialization error: …` text it did
//! when the message was carried as a `String`, so error text crossing the WASM
//! and React Native boundaries is unaffected.
