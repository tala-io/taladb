/*
 * TalaDB C FFI header.
 *
 * GENERATED FILE — do not edit. Regenerate with:
 *   packages/bindings/ffi/scripts/gen-header.sh
 * CI fails if this file and packages/bindings/ffi/src/lib.rs disagree.
 *
 * This is the stable C interface of the Rust taladb-ffi crate. Its consumers
 * are the React Native JSI HostObject and TurboModule in this repository and
 * the native Swift (tala-io/taladb-swift) and Kotlin (tala-io/taladb-kotlin)
 * packages, which ship as separate repositories.
 *
 * Compatibility
 * -------------
 *  TALADB_FFI_ABI_VERSION changes whenever a signature in this file changes
 *  incompatibly. A wrapper compiled against this header must check that
 *  taladb_ffi_abi_version() returns the same value before calling anything
 *  else; a mismatch means the library and header came from different releases.
 *
 * Ownership rules
 * ---------------
 *  - Strings IN  : caller-owned, UTF-8, null-terminated.
 *  - Strings OUT : heap-allocated by Rust; caller must free with
 *                  taladb_free_string().
 *  - Handles     : allocated by taladb_open(); freed by taladb_close().
 *  - Errors      : string functions return NULL; integer functions return -1,
 *                  with detail available from taladb_last_error().
